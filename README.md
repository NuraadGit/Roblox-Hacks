# Hey! 

If your reading this, or download anything from here, I **AM NOT** responsible for any damage you cause using this guide or exploits.

This was made for educational purposes.


## Introduction:

I wont be answering a lot of questions asked since most of them are already in this guide.

Questions:
### 1.1: What Is A Roblox Exploit?

An exploit is the use of glitches and software vulnerabilities in Roblox by a player to alter the game or gameplay for an unfair advantage.

Exploits have been defined as a form of cheating, so basically, an exploit is a program designed by developers and hacking enthusiast when it comes to gaming.

An exploit can allow you to use cheats in-game that would normally be un-allowed or frowned upon. Such as aim bot to locking on players heads/bodies ensuring every hit, as well as flying, super jump, wall hacks, unlimited money and other useful features.

Many users believe that the correct term for programs that change Roblox for a player's advantage is “exploiting”, and others believe “hacking” is the correct term.

However, hacking is the act of gaining unauthorized access to a system while exploiting is abusing a vulnerability to do the same.

### 1.2: Why does Windows think it's a virus?

Antiviruses usually mistake Roblox exploits as viruses due to their nature. Most if not all modern Roblox exploits work by injecting some sort of dll file into Roblox and running Lua code (Scripts) in the environment it creates.

Dll injection isnt just used by game cheats. They are also used by malware. Due to this antiviruses try to quarantine/delete all dll injectors that they detect without actually knowing if they are safe or not. This does not mean that all dlls are viruses.

### 1.3: Why does Google think it's a virus?

Most exploits are false positives, because google think it’s malicious as 1.2 question says.

Just make sure you downloaded the exploits on their official websites, as other people can skid them and add viruses into them.

If you have trust issues don't get an exploit.

### 1.4: I know that the exploit is a false positive, but how am I suppose to download it now?

Windows Solution: If you’re on google, just press CTRL + J and click “keep dangerous file”, don’t forget to turn off your anti-virus before clicking “keep dangerous file”, the reason you need to turn your antivirus off is so that it doesn't automatically delete the file.

I don't know what the mac solution is since I don't have one to test it out.

### 1.5: Why does the exploit say that my DLL or other files are missing?

It’s because you forgot to exclude the file with your anti virus.

in order to do this you need to go to (Windows Security > Exclusions) and whitelist the file, to prevent the anti-virus from removing it, after that you don't have to worry about your anti virus deleting the exploit, since it is whitelisted and wont be scanned by the Windows Defender.

Just make sure it stays on the file parent. Basically if you place it in your downloads folder, just keep it there, if you place it on anything else it will automatically be removed, and you'll have to redownload again.

If you have any other 3rd party anti-viruses such as avast, disable them. Also on the other note, avast is dogshit, don't use it, it's to overprotective and will literally think almost everything you download is a virus.

### 1.6: Why does some free exploits have annoying key systems?

The reason for this exploit having a key system is to support the developers of the exploit, this is for them to keep updating the exploits, domains and feeding their staff.

Also if an exploit is shit and has a key system, it's most likely that they are just after the money. If this certain exploit can't run most scripts change to another one.

### 1.7: Why does it say Roblox has been updated, please wait for an un-patch?

Roblox normally updates every Wednesday-Thursday depending on your time zone, so all exploits are normally patched. There are some cases where Roblox updates at Monday, Tuesday, and Friday.

Just wait for them to un-patch, it normally takes 1-24 hours, it depends on how fast they fix it.

If Roblox did a rollback update you don't have to worry. Since they're still at the same version as the exploit is, basically means the exploit isn't patched since they did a roll back update.

Be patient, and just wait for a patch, since the developers have no idea on what time they'll fix it. There are some scenarios where the developers are sleeping **ahem 3ds incident 6/24/2021**

### 1.8: Will I get banned from using exploits?

Obviously, you'll get banned for using exploits, but if you want to stay safe try not to keep it to obvious, then that would be no, unless roblox detects you using a certain exploit.

If you decide to abuse these cheats and make it very obvious that you are cheating, people can report you.

After around 1-2 weeks, your account will be flagged as a exploiter. You could be banned for around 1–7 days.

If after you continue to be reported for cheating, you will be permanently banned, if there is shown proof of course.

Therefore we do not encourage exploiting and we can not be held responsible for your account being banned or other issues you may encounter whilst using the hosted exploits.

Use them at your own risk.

Just remember you are breaking the Terms of Service so if you're caught by a Roblox admin, you can kiss your account goodbye. There are some videos where Admins don't care at all when you're exploiting, since they have the attention span of a goldfish.

### 1.9: Why does my exploit say that it can't find Roblox?

You are either using Windows 7, or you're using the windows/microsoft version. Make sure you're using the web version in order for your exploit to work, otherwise it wont.

### 1.10: Why does it say my exploit is outdated?

It looks like you're fucking blind and can't read what the exploit said, it literally said it's outdated. So in order to update, rerun the exploits bootstrapper, or reinstall it.

### 1.11: How do I prevent Roblox screenshotting or recording my screen?

If your exploit has an auto execute, add this script in it



```setfflag("AbuseReportScreenshot", "False")```
```setfflag("AbuseReportScreenshotPercentage", "0")```
Also make sure your exploit supports setfflag.

### 1.12: How do I prevent Roblox from IP banning me? I'll explain why this is useless.

If you're using a free exploit, make sure you're on an alt just to be safe since some exploits can be detected by Roblox.

If you're using a paid exploit you're pretty much safe but there are CHANCES to get banned, just make sure you're on an alt, if you want your main to be safe.

Just remember IF YOU WANT YOUR MAIN TO BE SAFE GO ON AN ALT. DON'T BE THOSE DUMBASSES THAT SAYS MY MAIN GOT BANNED FOR EXPLOITING.

Also make sure to use a VPN in order to prevent possible IP-bans, but I don't think you don't have to worry about that since Roblox.

Incase you don't want to be IP Banned, here is a VPN, that is free and has unlimited data.

https://protonvpn.com/

Their servers are always loaded so be prepared for lag.

I do not recommend using a VPN since Roblox rarely IP bans people for exploiting and such.

### 1.13: How do I check if I'm going to get banned in the next banwave, or if I'm tainted?

So if you want to know if your account is tainted or not you would have to press the following:

Win + R %appdata%

Go out of the Roaming folder

Go into the Local folder

Find Roblox Open the Logs File.

If you find an archive file in there open one of them and you'll see if you're tainted.

If it says "IsTainted=false" you're basically safe If it says "IsTainted=true" you'll be banned in the next banwave.

A detailed explenation:

Basically if you're on your main and the log says "IsTainted=true" it means you'll get banned in the next banwave. If you make a new account basically what Roblox does is that the logs will change into that new account, even if you stay on an innocent account the logs on your other main account will stay and will still be banned from the main account banned. Hope this helps.

Basically only your account that is tainted will get banned.

Note: ROBLOX rarely does banwaves nowadays, don't worry about this part

### 1.14: Why can't I run require(id) scripts?

Filtering Enabled is a form of anti-exploiting Roblox has implemented.

Basically, Filtering Enabled (FE) disables client modification of server values, or in simpler words, the client can't make changes to the game (credit to scriptinghelpers.org)

As Roblox says: Enabling Filtering Enabled is the best way of restricting exploiters from ruining your games. When it is enabled, with a few exceptions, changes made by clients will not replicate to the server (and therefore will not replicate to other clients). This means, if your game is properly designed, exploiters will find it much harder to operate in your game.

Meaning you won't be able to run these type of scripts.

### 1.15: How do I copy a game?

This is actually very simple, you just have to execute in this script:



```saveinstance()```
Your exploit must have a decompiler in order to do this.

### 1.16: How do I place backdoors in a game?

They add a hidden script in one of the parts, and when someone inserts the free model with the backdoor, and he publishes the game, the script with the backdoor will announce it to the discord via webhook, and will show the game that has the backdoored model in it.

You can go to YouTube and find how to make a backdoor if you wish to do this, but the dude who uses the model needs to have 0 iq so good luck.

### 1.17: What does Auto-Inject/Attach and Auto Execute mean?

Auto Attach/Inject basically, when you join a game and the exploit is running on the background it will automatically inject.

Auto Execute basically, as soon as you inject your exploit it automatically executes the script that is on your autoexec folder.

### 1.18: Why should I not get exploits from YouTube?

They are mostly skidded, and are most likely using an overused API, and then calls in their own exploit.

They also probably just want money, and stop developing it later on. (Through linkvertises.)

### 1.19: Are level 6-8 the same?

Yes they are, but in my opinion if I were to level exploits it would probably be on how good the functionality, injection speed, UI design, and powerful execution.

### 1.20: Are there any exploits that support Windows 7?

Barely any exploits support Windows 7, I'd recommend upgrading to Windows 10

### 1.21: Are linkvertises safe when getting keys?

 Yes, Just click the button and don't download anything, as it doesn't check for you downloading the file.
 Just make sure to remove any addons they want to add in your Chrome, and turn off linkvertises notifcations as they can be super annoying sometimes.

### 1.22: Is WeAreDevs/WRD a virus?

No it's not, it USED to be a virus since the owner got RATTED but now he has gotten his account back, and WRD is now safe to use. Although some of the exploits there have shady history.

### 1.23: Oh my god why does krnl.rocks, krnl.gg, and etc. say it's not working anymore?

Their domain might've gotten removed, new one is krnl.place, this might change in the future again, but I'll change it once I get info about it.

### 1.24: What do I do if an exploit database gets leaked and my information is in it?

Check if your password is there and immediately change it, if your IP is also leaked in the DB make sure to restart your router or something.

### 1.25: What are some fun scripts to use?

You can go ahead and check out someone's random script list on github, although it has not been updated for months.

You can see them here: [Github](https://github.com/dimension-sources/random-scripts-i-found)

Before we head to other details, I'll explain what the most used scripts are and what they do.
### 2.1: [Fly](https://wearedevs.net/d/Fly)

Enables your character to fly all around the game. (Easily detectable by games with good anti cheat)

### 2.2: [Noclip](https://wearedevs.net/d/Noclip)

Makes your entire avatar can collide false making, basically making you walk through walls. (sup jailbreaks og's who used cheat engine to no-clip)

### 2.3: [ESP](https://wearedevs.net/d/ESP)

Allows you to see players behind walls, also lets you see their name and what team they're on, pretty op on FPS games.

### 2.4: [Low Gravity](https://wearedevs.net/d/Gravity%20Switch)

Sets your gravity pretty low and makes you jump high and fall slowly, somewhat useful?

### 2.5: [Infinite Jump](https://wearedevs.net/d/Infinite%20Jump)

Allows you to jump infinitely, good with Low Gravity.

### What are some exploiting forums out there that I recommend?
#### 3.1: [V3rmillion](https://v3rmillion.net/)

Basically biggest exploiting forum out there, wholesome and somewhat toxic community, just need to get past the annoying captcha whenever you log in, there's also giveaways, sales, and etc., you can find scripts, and other exploits made by others, you can find almost all the good paid scripts here, super helpful community if you're asking adding more useful stuff into your script, just be careful on what you click, and make sure they do not log your ip, and make sure they are not an exe file, and last but not the least make sure there's also a virus scan before downloading an specific exe file.

#### 3.2: [Sir Memes Forum](https://forum.robloxscripts.com/)

Same as v3rm its a pretty big exploiting forum, theres also giveaways, sales and etc., and a very active community, you can also find scripts and other exploits, just be careful on what you click, and make sure they are not an .exe file, if you do download .exe make sure there's also a virus scan before downloading an specific .exe file.

#### 3.3: [WeAreDevs Forum](https://wearedevs.net/forum)

Good place to ask for scripts or find scripts, somewhat active community, just not the most helpful, but still good though.

I'd like to learn how to script (ROBLOX LUA), so how do I do it?
### 4.1: Explanation

First of, learning how to fully understand scripting is very hard as the progress can take to months, or years.

What you need is dedication, you won't be able to understand the basics in just a day. But if you're autistic enough maybe you will.

### 4.2: Tutorials

If you want to learn how to make simple scripts, and also intermediate ones I'd recommend wYn#0001's tutorials, they are very good and he also teaches you how UI Library works. Check his channel out.

It's recommended to know about Roblox LUA first, or any scripting languages in general (since it's easier to understand).

What are some places to get/download scripts?
#### 5.1: [robloxscripts](http://robloxscripts.com/)

Probably one of the most known script providing site for exploiting, it normally posts 5-15 scripts a day, and averages around 300+ scripts each month.

#### 5.2: [V3rmillion Forum](https://v3rmillion.net/)

A place where you can find paid scripts, FE scripts, exclusive scripts, and other utilities. This is where the big boys are at.

#### 5.3: [WeAreDevs Forum](https://wearedevs.net/forum)

A small community, you can get some scripts here but don't be that dumbass that sells "dark dex v2 rare" cause you're going to get shit on.

#### 5.4: [Dark Eccentric's Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9cmTG5FtUp6TQQO7I5W4_A)

Biggest script providing channel in youtube, you can find some fun FE scripts, and other stuff as well such as require scripts which can only be executed with serversides.

#### 5.5: Pastebin

You can find a few scripts in pastebin, but this is not very effective. But you can try to find certain scripts such as "revis admin pastebin"

I want to make a simple script hub, how do I do it?
### 6.1: How to make a simple one

I wish I had the energy to actually just make one but I'm just going to send a YouTube link on how to do it.

[Youtube](https://youtu.be/5g_n6756VP4) | [GUI To LUA Plugin](https://www.roblox.com/library/1343400903/Gui-to-Lua-Converter-Revamped\)

### 6.2: I want to use a UI Library instead of making my own UI

If you like to spice things up a bit I'd recommend using a UI Library if you're lazy to make a GUI yourself, here's a github where you can find a lot of [UI Libraries](https://github.com/bloodball/UI-Librarys)

How do I make an executor with an already made API?
### 6.1: Getting the API's

Two of the most popular API's known are [WRD API](https://wearedevs.net/d/Exploit%20API) and [EasyXploit API](https://easyexploits.com/downloadexploit?id=6)

You can find the tutorial for WRD API here, and EasyXploits API here.

### 6.2: Tools Needed

You need microsoft's visual studio code in order to work on the API's [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

What are some good ServerSides? I'll be listing and explain why serversides are not worth it.

**~~TOPK3K~~**

**(DISCONTINUED)**

~~Costs: 20.00-25.00 Dollars~~

~~Probably most known serverside, out there, has a few popular games~~ but the problem is IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

**ServerSides don't last long, it can end whenever, the games are limited, there might be a lot of players but it's most likely just people that don't bother at all. It's like their too shy to chat. I'm not gonna list other serversides because they're not worth it brother. If you're looking for free serversides, NONE, and if there was they'd probably be shit.**

Now that we finished explaining the basics, here are some exploits I recommend and NOT recommend.

## Free Exploits:

[JJSploit](https://wearedevs.net/d/JJSploit)

Most popular free exploit, I honestly don't recommend this, the UI is shitty, every time you inject it's a guaranteed crash, whenever you execute a script you literally drop 30 frames. If you execute print("hello world") it might even crash that's how bad it is, the older version could do better than the new versions.

[KRNL](https://krnl.place/)

Most popular recommended free exploit, I recommend this, good UI, rarely crashes, can run some complicated scripts, best free exploit IMO, just has a key system but it's to help the creators of the exploit.

[Oxygen U](https://wearedevs.net/d/Oxygen%20U)

Basically your KRNL backup if it's down or in maintenance, good UI, rarely crashes, can run some complicated scripts, also has a key system but same as KRNL it is to help the creators of the exploit.

[Coco Z](https://wearedevs.net/d/Coco%20Z)

Smooth UI, decent executor. If you're using this you're probably impatient about KRNL or Oxygen U's key system, since this one lasts for 3 days.

[Kiwi X](https://wearedevs.net/d/Kiwi%20X)

Pretty cool UI, can execute a few complicated scripts has alot of functions, also recommend this, BUT this has too much pop ups so I recommend just using KRNL, or Oxygen.

[Fluxus](https://wearedevs.net/d/Fluxus)

Good ol' ~~mac~~ exploit that merged with scriptware and is now pc only. It is not available in mac anymore but this is still a very good exploit for pc. Good UI, sometimes crashes.

## Paid Exploits:
[Synapse X](https://x.synapse.to/)

Costs: 15.00-20.00 Dollars

The one and only Synapse X, the best of the best, hottest paid exploit in the market, heavily recommending this. Rarely crashes, good UI, fast updates. Also has synapse only scripts available. Can execute almost all scripts, and is undetected.

[Script-Ware](https://script-ware.com/)

Costs: 13.00-19.99 Dollars

Has a dashboard, and has a friends list which I think is pretty cool, good UI, fast updates, also has a very big script hub, and a lot of featured scripts, also available on mac, make sure to keep your eyes on this exploit, it is evolving it might even be better than synapse in the future, who knows.

DISCONTINUED - ~~[ProtoSmasher](https://protosmasher.net/)~~

~~Costs: 15.00 Dollars~~

~~Good exploit, can run complicated scripts, good UI, powerful executor, you can save up 5$ to get Synapse instead, but this is also fine if you don't want to.~~

~~OFFSALE - [Sentinel](https://painexist.gg/)~~

~~Costs: 15.00 Dollars~~

~~It has a good UI, fast injection, can run complicated scripts, good stability, but unfortunately it is currently offsale.~~

If you want a comparison, here you go:

Important things to note:
Do not join the fake KRNL discord serverdiscord.gg/krnl they will token log you, do not download anything that is given by the fake Ice Bear.

WeAreDevs is safe, back in 2018 the owner got RATTED, and placed hidden viruses in the exploits that used to be there. It is now safe and there is no need to worry about it.
Do be careful with them regardless.

KRNL support they have their own support in their discord server. (https://krnl.place/invite.html)
